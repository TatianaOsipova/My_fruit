                    There are various factors that influence one's mood. Our lifestyle, what we eat, and how often we
                    workout affects our mood significantly. Although external factors can alter one's mood temporarily,
                    these factors have a longer impact on our mental health.
                </p>
                <p class="main__info-descr"> <span>Fruits</span> are a very healthy food group.
                    Fruits are packed with numerous nutrients that aid the proper

                                        <p>Papaya is yet another fruit that boosts immunity and comes loaded with
                                            vitamin C. You can get almost double the daily prescribed amount of vitamin
                                            C in a single medium fruit.
                                            Papayas contain a digestive enzyme called papain that harbours
                                            anti-inflammatory effects. Papayas also have substantial amounts of
                                            potassium, magnesium, and folate, all of which improve your overall
                                            well-being.

                                            protein, manganese, vitamin A, folate, thiamine, and magnesium.
                                            You must practice the daily consumption of organic foods as they adhere to
                                            international standards of healthy meals. Organic farming safeguards the
                                            environment because of its eco-friendly cultivation practices.
                                            Grapefruit contains an enormous variety of antioxidants.

                                        <p>Blueberries are one of the best fruits that boost immunity, containing a type
                                            of flavonoid called anthocyanin, which exhibits antioxidant properties and
                                            can help boost the immune system.
                                            A 2016 study concluded that flavonoids play a pivotal role in the immune
                                            defence system of the respiratory tract of a person.
                                            One cup of blueberries contains about 4 grams of fibre and merely 15 grams
                                            of carbohydrates. You also get 24 per cent of your routine recommended
                                            vitamin C and about 36 per cent of the approved dose of vitamin K.

                                        <p>Pineapple is rich in vitamin C and manganese. It contains an enzyme called
                                            bromelain.
                                            Bromelain helps the body to absorb antibiotics, control diarrhoea, and even
                                            fight diabetes, heart disease, as well as cancer, corresponding to a study
                                            conducted by Biotechnology Research International.
                                            You can incorporate pineapple into your diet by eating it as a snack or
                                            including it in your smoothies. You can also put some pineapple in your
                                            oatmeal or chop it up into some salsa.

                                        <p>When it comes to fruits that boost immunity, watermelons help you stay
                                            hydrated, boasting many other health benefits such as lowering blood
                                            pressure, regulating the immune system, and helping with muscle soreness.
                                            Watermelon contains a plethora of nutrients such as vitamin C, copper,
                                            potassium, vitamin A, as well as vitamin B5.
                                            Watermelon also contains a significant level of citrulline that you can find
                                            in the white part of the watermelon rind.

                                        <p>According to a study, an avocado contains substantial amounts of vitamin E,
                                            iron, and potassium and is high in monounsaturated fat that helps lower your
                                            cholesterol and promotes a healthy immune system.
                                            The potassium in avocados regulates blood pressure and fights fatigue, and
                                            they are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the risk of heart
                                            disease.
                                            Other nutrients include vitamins B6, C, and D, which are required by your
                                            immune system to keep you healthy.

                                            Vitamin C boosts the production of white blood cells to fight infection,

                                        <p>Apples are cheap, readily obtainable, sweet, and healthy. Not only do they
                                            boost immunity, but reduce your weight, which can help prevent several
                                            diseases linked to obesity.
                                            A study concluded that subjects who ate apple slices before a meal consumed
                                            an average of 200 fewer calories during their main-course meal.
                                            Apple peels and flesh contain polyphenols, which is an antioxidant that can
                                            help reduce the risk of strokes and heart disease by significantly boosting
                                            immunity.

                                        <p>As per the BBC Good Food, pomegranates comprise about three times the amount
                                            of antioxidants you will receive in either green tea or red wine.
                                            Studies have also indicated that pomegranates can fight inflammation and
                                            lower blood pressure as well as the risk of heart disease.
                                            Pomegranates contain two unique compounds that include punicalagin and
                                            punicic acid. Because of these compounds, pomegranates have been linked to a
                                            greater success rate in fighting some classes of cancers.

                                        <p>Most people immediately turn to vitamin C after catching a cold. Such

                                            Vitamin C increases the production of white blood cells, which are the
                                            frontline of defence against fighting infections.
                                            Almost all citrus fruits are rich sources of vitamin C. Some popular citrus
